## Overview

[Magma](https://magmacore.org/) is an open-source software platform that gives network operators 
an open, flexible and extendable mobile core network solution.

[Juju](https://juju.is/) is a tool used to deploy cloud infrastructure and applications and manage their operations 
from Day 0 through Day 2.

In this tutorial, we will use Juju to deploy the Magma 4G core as well as a simulated radio
and a cellphone from the [srsRAN](https://www.srslte.com/) project.
